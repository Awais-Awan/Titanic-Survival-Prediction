# Titanic Survival Prediction: Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Prediction** project! This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether passengers aboard the Titanic survived or not based on various features like age, sex, class, and fare. The goal is to build a robust predictive model and showcase data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular datasets for machine learning beginners. It contains details about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status. The task is to predict if a passenger survived based on the following features:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

The project explores various machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **Python**: Core language used for the project
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization
